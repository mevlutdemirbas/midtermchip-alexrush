# Introduction: MPR 121 Capacitive Touch Keypad #

This wiki includes sample codes for using the capacitive touch keypad shield. The first code is a simple modification from the sample code that is found in the source folder, allowing the keypad to write to the window as well as light LED's corresponding to each key. The second code is a simple password system. The Arduino will wait for four key presses and compare them against a predetermined code. If the code matches the LED’s will light up, if they do not the LED’s will flash a few times then wait for another code. For  videos of the code, and the schematic of the circuit seen in the videos, check the wiki.
